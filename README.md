# Quote-Generator
Read random quotes and create art at the same time!

My goal at the start of this project was to implement a constructor function, which I used to randomly generate the set of circles. 
I am fascinated by generative art, so playing with this site makes me giddy.

Then I decided to use this project as the background for the Free Code Camp quote generator project. Not satisfied to use their vetted quote API, I ventured out to find one.
Hence I have learned much about API's and CORS lately. The project functions appropriately locally (through the use of the CORS.io proxy) and functions somewhat imperfectly hosted on Github by using the API's secure portal.

I am stumped as to why only one quote is retrieved per browser instance (not per click or refresh). If you're looking at this and have any ideas I'd love to hear them.

Yeah. Enjoy playing with the circles anyway!
